        <h2>ExtraDock 4.1.3 – Desktop Widget Mode & Dock Freedom! 🖥️</h2>
        <h3>✨ What's New & Improved</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Desktop Widget Mode:</strong> Turn any dock into a desktop widget! Enable the new "Act as
                Desktop Widget" toggle in dock properties and your dock will sit beautifully behind app windows like
                embedded desktop content. Click or drag to interact – the dock smartly elevates to the front, then
                gracefully settles back after you're done. It's like having a dock and a widget in one!</li>
            <li><strong>Hide Native macOS Dock:</strong> Go all-in on ExtraDock! New global setting lets you hide
                Apple's native Dock completely. Your original Dock preferences are safely saved and restored when you
                toggle it back on. ExtraDock remembers your choice across launches – set it once and forget it!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🐛 Bug Fixes</h3>

            <li><strong>Safari Web Apps & Aliases Fixed:</strong> Adding Safari web apps, aliases, and symlink items to
                your docks now works flawlessly! Both drag-and-drop and the Add Item dialog properly resolve all URL
                types, with smart fallback search across your Applications folders.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoother Upgrades:</strong> Improved data compatibility ensures a seamless upgrade experience –
                no crashes when updating from older versions!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🚀 What's Next?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed Screen Switching Issue:</strong> Interacting with the dock while using fullscreen apps no
                longer causes unexpected space or screen switches. Your current workspace stays intact!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔧 Auto-Hide Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Edge-Sensitive Reveal:</strong> Auto-hidden docks now respond when your mouse approaches screen

                tracking behavior even when the dock is hidden.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🎯 Widget Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Live Configuration Updates:</strong> Widget settings now apply immediately without requiring
                multiple selections or re-opening the configuration panel.</li>
            <li><strong>Better LiveDock Widget Sizing:</strong> The LiveDock widget now automatically recalculates dock
                size when visible items change, with proper positioning adjustments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔧 General Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Collapse/Expand Settings:</strong> Improved settings experience for a better user
                experience.</li>
