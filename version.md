VERSION: 4.0.4
DETAILS:
Few improvments and new features:
1. Improved the icon libary and icon change process to be more user friendly and intuitive.
2. Add a new Theme settings - and for the winter season we added a new theme - Snow theme, this will add a snow effect to the dock. - we will add more themes in the future. and settings to configure the theme.
3. Add a new Widget - "Live Dock" - this widget will copy the real macOS dock items and show them on your extra dock. this is a prefect solution for users who wabt to copy the macOS dock to diffrent screen keeping both of them visible.
A small heads up, for making the "Live Dock" work really live and in sync with changes of the macOS Dock we need to ask for Accessibility permission.
This is only fot this widget and also it is not a requeried permission, this is just to get the full experience.
The core functionality of ExtraDock is still the same, and the user can still use all the features of ExtraDock without giving the Accessibility permission.
4. Add drag to folder and drag to open feature to the dock - now when you drag an item to a folder in ExtraDock it will be added to the folder, and when you drag an item to a open app in ExtraDock it will be opened in the app - so if you will drag a file to an IDE it will be opened in the IDE and if you will drag a file to a folder it will be added to the folder for example.
5. BETA Widget - TamaDocky! - this is a new widget that will show a small pet on your dock, cat for now. you can feed it, play with it, and enjoy the company of your pet. this widget is in beta and will be updated in the future to add more features and customization options.
