ExtraDock — What's New

  Dock Space Reservation

  Your fixed docks now reserve their screen space — when you maximize or zoom a window, it stops at the dock
   edge instead of hiding behind it. Works automatically with expand-style resizes, with an optional "Active
   on Drag" mode for manual window moves too.

  Native macOS Trash Integration

  The Trash widget now offers a Native Trash mode that connects to your real macOS Trash. See a live item
  count from your actual Trash folder and drag files to trash using Finder — no more virtual-only trash.
  Switch between native and virtual mode anytime.

  Hotkey Auto-Hide Timer

  Show your dock with a hotkey and it auto-hides after a set delay (3–60 seconds). Moving your mouse over
  the dock pauses the timer, so it stays visible while you're using it. Perfect for quick-glance workflows.

  Left Click Behavior Options

  Customize what happens when you click a dock icon:
  - Normal — standard app activation
  - Toggle Minimize — click to minimize, click again to restore

  Hide File Extensions

  Non-app items (documents, scripts, files) can now hide their file extension for a cleaner dock appearance.
   Configure per-item through the new item settings window.

  Smarter Notification Badges

  - Badges now display the full notification count instead of capping at 99+
  - Dynamic badge sizing adapts to the number of digits
  - Improved reliability with thread-safe polling and crash-safe preference saving
  - Better badge detection on macOS Tahoe with deeper accessibility traversal and fallback mode

  Drag Removal Confirmation

  Accidentally dragging items off the dock is now protected — a confirmation dialog asks before removing an
  item.

  Automatic Folder Repair

  Folders that were incorrectly detected as apps are now automatically repaired on load, with a manual
  "Repair Folders" button available in dock management.

  Improved Trash Widget Config

  The Trash widget settings panel has been redesigned with clear toggle switches and a collapsible
  permissions section — no more dense text walls.

  Stability & Reliability

  - Fixed vertical dock shifting when badge counts update on macOS Tahoe
  - Hardened persistence during drag reorder and system sleep
  - Fixed multi-add rollback in dock management
  - Improved hotkey auto-hide timer pause on mouse interaction
