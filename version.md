What's New

Space Awareness Widget

New widget: Space Awareness — Shows apps that have windows open in the current macOS Space, giving you instant context about what's active on each
desktop.
Minimized app retention — Minimized apps stay visible in the widget so you don't lose track of them when switching focus.
Per-screen scoping — Space Awareness items are scoped to each dock's screen, so multi-monitor setups show the right apps on the right display.
Automatic cleanup on space switch — Retained apps are cleared when you switch Spaces, keeping the widget fresh and relevant.
Configurable left-click action — Choose what happens when you click a Space Awareness item (e.g., activate, show menu, etc.).
Bug Fixes & Improvements

Fixed space jumps from dock animations — Dock frame resize animations no longer cause unexpected Space switches.
Improved dock item classification — Better detection of package documents when dragging items into the dock, resulting in more accurate item type
assignment and icons.
