VERSION: 3.9.2
DETAILS:
Big feature added: Widgets support!
We have added a new widget system to our docks that will allow us to add widgets to our docks.
We started with a spacer widget that will allow you to set custom spacing between docks items,
With this feature we opened a new door to create custom widgets for your docks so stay tuned for more widgets to come!
Also in this version we added some design fixes and improvements to the app,
You can add a default few cm space from the edges of the screen from the dock to get more macOS like experience.
Also you can edit borders, backgroudns, opacity, blur, and more to make your docks look even more beautiful and unique.
