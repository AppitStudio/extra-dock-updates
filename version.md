VERSION: 4.0.2
DETAILS:
This version is adding morecustomization options for ExtraDock based on the users feedback.
The three main features are:
1. Cutomize app/folders icons! this one is huge, users can upload any icon they want to the app and use it as their app/folder icon, and also import icons from the URL, and the users have in the setting of the app an Icon Library to manage their icons
All the icons are searchable, and when uploaded to an app it will attached to the app so the user can search by app name or icon file name.
2. Improved dock position after restart - fixed a bug that the dock position was not saved after restart sometimes, and now the dock will remember its position and state after app/macOS restart.
3. Improved folder color change - fix issues with the folder icon color feature.
