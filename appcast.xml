        <h2>ExtraDock 4.0.2 – Make It Yours! 🎨</h2>
        <h3>✨ What's New & Improved</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom App & Folder Icons:</strong> This is huge! Upload any icon you want and use it for your apps or folders. Import icons from URLs, and manage your entire icon collection in the new Icon Library in settings. All icons are fully searchable – find them by app name or icon file name. Your dock, your style!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🐛 Bug Fixes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Dock Position Persistence:</strong> Fixed an issue where dock position wasn't always saved after restart. Your dock will now reliably remember its position and state after app or macOS restarts.</li>
            <li><strong>Folder Color Fix:</strong> Resolved issues with the folder icon color feature for smoother customization.</li>
        </ul>
