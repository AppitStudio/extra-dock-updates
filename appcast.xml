        <h2>ExtraDock 4.1.0 – Notifications in Your Dock! 🔔</h2>
        <h3>✨ What's New & Improved</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dock Notifications:</strong> A highly requested feature is here! ExtraDock can now display notification badges directly on apps in your dock! See at a glance which apps need your attention – no more missing important messages or updates. Works seamlessly with both regular apps in your dock and the Live Dock widget!</li>
            <li><strong>Hide Apps from Live Dock:</strong> Take control of your Live Dock widget! Right-click any app and select "Hide From This Live Dock" to remove apps you don't want to see. Easily manage your hidden apps list from the Live Dock settings – perfect for keeping your dock clean and focused on what matters!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔐 A Note About Permissions</h3>
        <p>To enable dock notifications, ExtraDock requires Accessibility permission. This permission allows ExtraDock to read notification badges from your apps. You can enable this feature from the app settings page – and as always, you're in complete control!</p>

        <h3>🎯 Built from Your Feedback</h3>
        <p>Notification badges have been one of the most requested features from our community! You wanted to see your app notifications without constantly checking the main dock, and now you can. Thank you for helping us prioritize what matters most to you!</p>

        <h3>🚀 What's Next?</h3>
        <p>We're continuing to enhance the ExtraDock experience based on your feedback. More customization options, more widgets, and more ways to make your dock uniquely yours are on the way. Keep sharing your ideas – you're shaping the future of ExtraDock!</p>
