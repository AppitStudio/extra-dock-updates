        <h2>ExtraDock 4.0.4 – Smarter Dock, More Fun! 🎉</h2>
        <h3>✨ What's New & Improved</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Icon Library:</strong> We've completely revamped the icon library and icon change process! The new experience is more intuitive and user-friendly, making it easier than ever to find and apply custom icons to your dock items.</li>
            <li><strong>Theme System Expansion:</strong> ExtraDock's theme engine gets even better! Introducing the magical Snow Theme for the winter season – watch beautiful snowflakes drift across your dock. We're just getting started with themes, and more seasonal and stylistic options are coming soon!</li>
            <li><strong>Live Dock Widget:</strong> The most-requested widget is here! The Live Dock widget mirrors your real macOS dock in your extra dock – perfect for multi-monitor setups where you want your dock visible on every screen. It automatically syncs with any changes you make to your macOS dock in real-time!</li>
            <li><strong>Drag to Folder & Apps:</strong> Supercharge your workflow! Drag files directly onto folders in ExtraDock to add them, or drag files onto apps to open them. Drop a file on your IDE to edit it, or onto a folder to move it there – it just works!</li>
            <li><strong>🐱 TamaDocky (BETA):</strong> Meet your new dock companion! TamaDocky brings a cute little cat to your dock. Feed it, play with it, and enjoy having a virtual pet right in your workspace. This is just the beginning – more pets, features, and customization options are coming!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔐 A Note About Permissions</h3>
        <p>To enable real-time syncing for the Live Dock widget, ExtraDock may request Accessibility permission. This is <strong>completely optional</strong> and only needed for the Live Dock widget's real-time features. All other ExtraDock features work perfectly without this permission – you're always in control!</p>

        <h3>🎯 Built from Your Feedback</h3>
        <p>Every feature in this release came from your suggestions! The Live Dock widget, drag-and-drop improvements, and theme customization are all things you asked for. Your feedback shapes ExtraDock's future, and we couldn't be more grateful!</p>

        <h3>🚀 What's Next?</h3>
        <p>TamaDocky is just the beginning of making your dock more fun and personal! We're working on more pets, more themes, and even more ways to customize your dock experience. Keep sharing your ideas – you're helping shape the future of ExtraDock!</p>

        <p>Thank you to the amazing ExtraDock community for your continued support and fantastic feature suggestions. You inspire us to keep pushing the boundaries of what a dock can do!</p>
