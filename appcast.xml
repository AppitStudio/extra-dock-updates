        <h2>ExtraDock 4.0.9 – Live Dock Perfected & Lock It Down! 🔒</h2>
        <h3>✨ What's New & Improved</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Live Dock Widget:</strong> The Live Dock widget just got a major upgrade! We've significantly improved stability and reliability, and refined the animations to feel more natural and dock-like. Your mirrored dock now behaves even more like the real macOS dock!</li>
            <li><strong>Smarter Screen Recognition:</strong> This is one of the most complex features in ExtraDock, and your feedback has been invaluable! We've made significant improvements to how ExtraDock recognizes and handles different screen setups. Whether you're using multiple monitors, external displays, or unique configurations – your docks will now behave more consistently and reliably.</li>
            <li><strong>NEW: Lock To Position:</strong> Take complete control of your dock placement! Right-click on any dock and select "Lock/Unlock To Position" to prevent it from moving. This powerful new feature lets you organize your docks exactly where you want them and keep them there – no more accidental repositioning!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🎯 Built from Your Feedback</h3>
        <p>Every improvement in this release came directly from your reports and suggestions! The screen recognition improvements, in particular, wouldn't have been possible without your detailed feedback about different monitor setups. Thank you for helping us tackle this complex challenge!</p>

        <h3>🚀 What's Next?</h3>
        <p>We're continuing to refine and perfect the ExtraDock experience based on your feedback. More features, more polish, and more ways to customize your workspace are on the way. Keep sharing your ideas – you're shaping the future of ExtraDock!</p>
